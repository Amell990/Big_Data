# To implement a basic Streamlit dashboard for temperature monitoring, the following Python code snippet can be used in a Colab or local environment with streamlit installed:

# streamlit_temperature_dashboard.py
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

st.title("RotorWind Machine Temperature Dashboard")

# Mock temperature data
data = pd.read_csv("temperature_log.csv")  # Replace with real-time stream or API source
st.line_chart(data['Temperature'])

critical_threshold = 85  # example value in Celsius
if data['Temperature'].iloc[-1] > critical_threshold:
    st.error("ALERT: Temperature has exceeded safe threshold!")
else:
    st.success("Machine operating within safe temperature range.")

'''
Deploy via:
streamlit run streamlit_temperature_dashboard.py

This can serve as a prototype tool for RotorWindâ€™s internal demonstrations and iterative dashboard design.
